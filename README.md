# micro-MVC (3.0)

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a3246d5ff1c745c4a77e5f15a4893378)](https://www.codacy.com/app/g.delaportas/micro-MVC?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=g0d/micro-MVC&utm_campaign=badger)

An agile, small, productive and robust MVC framework for PHP (with integrated AJAX support).

micro-MVC is a simple, agile and powerful MVC framework that empowers developers to write 
MVC-based code very quickly. Although there are tons of free and open source MVC frameworks out there, they 
usually end up becoming too complicated as they are stuffed with a bunch of infinite extensions that only 
5% of devs really use them at some point.

micro-MVC is trying to be hassle free, straightforward and helps you stay on track. micro-MVC API is robust 
and solves roughly 95% of all the everyday issues you face under development with PHP and JS.

micro-MVC is optimized, secure, lightning fast and consumes the least resources possible.
The framework runs on nearly any platform including embedded systems and has been tested extensively in several hardware configurations. Finally, the framework comes with out-of-the-box configurations for Apache and NGINX offering enterprise-ready security, smart caching and compression.

Enjoy!

Best,
