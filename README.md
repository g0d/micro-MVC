# micro-MVC
An agile, small, productive and robust MVC framework for PHP.

micro-MVC is a simple, agile but concrete and powerful MVC framework that empowers developers to write 
MVC-based code very quickly. Although there are tons of free and open source MVC frameworks out there, they 
usually end up to become too complicated as they are stuffed with a bunch of infinite extensions that only 
5% of devs really use them.

micro-MVC is trying to be hassle free, straightforward and helps you stay on track. micro-MVC API is concrete 
and solves roughly the 95% of all the everyday issues you face under development with PHP.


Best,
