# micro-MVC (2.0)
An agile, small, productive and robust MVC framework for PHP (with integrated AJAX support).

micro-MVC is a simple, agile and powerful MVC framework that empowers developers to write 
MVC-based code very quickly. Although there are tons of free and open source MVC frameworks out there, they 
usually end up to become too complicated as they are stuffed with a bunch of infinite extensions that only 
5% of devs really use them.

micro-MVC is trying to be hassle free, straightforward and helps you stay on track. micro-MVC API is robust 
and solves roughly 95% of all the everyday issues you face under development with PHP.

micro-MVC version 2.0 has been upgraded and optimized to be lightning fast and use as less resource as possible.
The new framework can now run in embedded systems. It has been tested extensively in several hardware configurations 
and the minimum requirements are CPU: 300MHz, RAM: 32MB, DISK: 600KB.

Enjoy!

Best,
