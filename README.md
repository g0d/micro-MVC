[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/889562a17e174c438fd56d35780822b0)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/g0d/micro-MVC/dashboard)

An agile, small, productive and robust MVC framework for PHP & JS (with integrated AJAX support) for the enterprise.

micro-MVC is a simple, agile and powerful MVC framework that empowers business-thinking professionals to write MVC-based or 
AJAX-based code with ease. Although there are tons of free and open source MVC frameworks out there, they 
usually end up becoming too complicated as they are overbloated with a bunch of infinite extensions that only 
5% of developers really use them at some point.

micro-MVC is not yet another framework for the hype. It follows a professional approach, trying to be hassle free, straightforward and helps you stay on track. micro-MVC API is robust 
and solves roughly 95% of all the everyday issues you face under development with PHP and JS.

micro-MVC is optimized for stable coding, it's secure, lightning fast and consumes the least resources possible.
The framework is backwards compatible down to PHP 5, runs on nearly any platform including embedded systems and has been 
tested extensively in several hardware configurations. Also, it comes with out-of-the-box configurations for Apache and NGINX 
offering enterprise-ready security, smart caching and compression.

The latest releases come with the "Awesome!" platform that acts as a shorthand for micro-MVC folder structure and provides an easy way 
for developers to access and manage their front-end and back-end code separately and the designers to work without conflicts almost in parallel.

Finally, on Dec-10-2020, micro-MVC has been audited, tested thoroughly for security vulnerabilities and put under stress with 
thousands of requests per minute from all over the globe. The results proved that micro-MVC is dependable and highly secure.
