[Installation Process]
1. Make sure that your PHP configuration has this: "short_open_tag=On"
2. Make sure that your directory is fully writable by your web user: nginx, apache, nobody, etc.
3. If you have multiple folders or installed micro-MVC in a subfolder, better use the: Name-based Virtual Host feature
